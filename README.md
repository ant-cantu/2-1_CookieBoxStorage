## About Tree Area Calculator

This is a project I made for my computer programming class using C++.
This project was created within the first few weeks of my class and
is very simple and follows exactly what my professor wanted. I am
limited on the techniques I can use based on what we have covered
in our class textbook.

The application takes the users inputs and calculates the number
of trees available to plant in the given area and the total
amount of space the trees take.

## Getting Started

This is a standalone application, no installation is required.

1. Download the file
> [Click to Download](https://github.com/ant-cantu/TreeAreaCalculator/blob/main/L1-4.exe)

2. Run the application.
3. Make sure the L1-3DATA.txt file is in the same location as the executable.
5. Review the output in the console.
6. Review the output in the newly created file: L1-3DATA.dat

## Usage

The program is made using C++, This program takes the length of a 
field, the diameter of a fully grown tree and the distance
between each tree, and outputs the total number of trees 
available to plant in the given area and the total 
amount of space the trees take up.

It is assumed the user will enter numeric values as there are no error
checks within this code.
