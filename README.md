# Cookie Box Storage

## About Cookie Box Storage

This is a project I made for my computer programming class using C++.
This project was created within the first few weeks of my class and
is very simple and follows exactly what my professor wanted. I am
limited on the techniques I can use based on what we have covered
in our class textbook. This assignment is coming from my second
lab for the semester.

The application takes the users inputs and calculates the number
of number of cookies boxes needed to hold cookies, with the leftover
cookies displayed and the number of containers needed to store the
cookie boxes, with the leftover boxes displayed.

## Usage

The program is made using C++, This program will take the users input
